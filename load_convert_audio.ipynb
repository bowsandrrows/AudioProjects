    "- Y‚Äëaxis (Amplitude) ‚Üí This is the signal strength, normalized to between roughly -0.6 and +0.6 here.\n",
    "- Positive values: air pressure waves pushing outward (relative to the microphone).\n",
    "- Negative values: waves pulling inward.\n",
    "- The squiggly line ‚Üí Changes in amplitude over time ‚Äî basically, the raw audio wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç What you can read from it\n",
    "- Peaks and troughs = Louder moments. Taller spikes mean higher amplitude (more volume).\n",
    "- Flat or low‚Äëamplitude sections = Quieter parts or silence.\n",
    "- Variations in density of wiggles\n",
    "- Closely packed oscillations ‚Üí higher‚Äëpitched sounds.\n",
    "- More spread‚Äëout oscillations ‚Üí lower‚Äëpitched sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Insights that could be extracted\n",
    "- Dynamic range ‚Üí This signal‚Äôs variation isn‚Äôt huge (¬±0.6), so the recording might not be fully normalized for max loudness.\n",
    "- Structure ‚Üí You could zoom in on certain sections to analyze specific events ‚Äî speech, beats, or instrument notes.\n",
    "- Next step ‚Üí Converting this to a spectrogram would show how frequencies evolve over the 20 seconds, which is more revealing than amplitude alone.\n"
